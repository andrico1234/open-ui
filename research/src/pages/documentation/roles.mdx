Here are the different ways folks contribute to Open UI, and the different skills/pieces of work.

### Contributor

A contributor is any person who has participated in some way, either by joining a meeting and participating, or writing on an issue or PR. If you’re reading this, you’re likely already a contributor. Thank you :D!

### Champion

A champion has slightly more responsbility than a contributor. A champion is responsible for moving a proposal from one stage to the next, attending meetings, gathering input, synthesizing it, and advancing it through the [stages](/working-mode). In order to become a champion you need to:

- Be a member of the community group
- Be able to alot time to attend weekly meetings while your feature is being worked on
- Be available to review and advance tasks outside of the weekly meeting

### Editor

An editor owns a specification, and is responsible for ensuring it develops and remains stable. This means reviewing PRs to the specifications you are an editor of, considering input, and updating prose in a consistent and accessible voice. In order to become an editor you need to:

- Be a member of the community group
- Have five substantial technical contributions to a specification that you wish to edit
- Be nominated for editorship by either the chairs or someone who is currently an editor of that specification
- Be resolved on by the community during telecon or two other editors or chairs

### Chair

The chairs' primary responsibilities are to facilitate weekly meetings, ensure progress towards goals is made, mentor and onboard contributors, champions, and editors, create and foster a respectful and productive atmosphere for the community, enforce the working mode.
