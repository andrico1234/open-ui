## Proposal Page <a href="#proposal-page" id="proposal-page"></a>

The proposal page will summarize your findings, conclusions, and unresolved points.

Define your proposal page front matter.
The `pathToResearch` key tells your proposal page where its research page is hosted.

### Working through the proposal template

Beginning to spec a control can feel daunting and it's hard to know where to start.
The spec template headings should be used as a guide to ensure that all aspects of creating
a high quality control that is inclusive for all users is covered. Not all sections are required for
every control. If you remove them, make sure to denote that you removed them and why in a PR.

### Gaining consensus on a change

Of course, merely documenting what exists does not necessarily make something a good design.
For each normative change that you make to your spec proposal, open an issue to outline the change
that you're proposing. You should provide any research to support the change(s) that you're proposing.

### Do **NOT** deviate from already standardized content

Open UI is trying to define an entire control in a single location. Currently, in order to
build a complete control you'll need to refer to specifications in WHATWG, CSSWG, and WAI-ARIA.
Open UI will enable an author to build a control referencing a single location.

While this will be helpful, Open UI should not re-define aspects of other specifications.
If you identity an aspect of a control that exists in the majority of design systems but is
_not_ currently in a web platform specification, you **should** define it in the Open UI spec proposal.
Upon getting resolution of this proposal a subsequent issue should be filed against the necessary specification
to get its addition. To make it a bit more clear, let's take a concrete example:

The Open UI `<select>` proposal has a definition for an `open` state. This is currently _not_ defined
in a web platform specification. In order for this to make it into the web platform an issue will need
to be filed again the WHATWG HTML specification.

**Note:** In order to understand how Open UI achieves consensus, please review to our [charter](https://open-ui.org/charter)

### Denoting Questions

There is an expectation that your proposal will have open questions. Leverage the following HTML to
denote them, they'll be incremented automatically and pre-pended with 'Question'.

`<p class="question">QUESTION</p>`

# Definitions <a href="#definitions" id="definitions"></a>

Since Open UI is about doing research across design systems to understand their components
and controls it's important to have clear definitions. For the purposes of Open UI here are
some common terms used in specifications and their definitions.

## Component <a href="#definition-component" id="definition-component"></a>

The dictionary defines a component as, "a part or element of a larger whole" and this is
true for components in a design system's component library. Components normally have a meaning,
although this meaning may not be presented to the user (such as a utility component). The _meaning_ is
defined by the component's model, defined [parts](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shadow-parts-1/#part-attr) and
[slots](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-slot-element), and states.

## Control <a href="#definition-control" id="definition-control"></a>

A control is a type of component that allows some form of user interaction. The control has controller code
that manages the transition of the component's states and the model based on end-user interaction with the
defined parts.

## Composite Component

It is often necessary to produce a component that contains other components. For example, the `<file>`
control is a component that normally contains an `<input>` component and a `<button>` component.
These types of components are commonly referred to as composite components.
