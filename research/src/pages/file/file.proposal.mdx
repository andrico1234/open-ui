# File Input Component Specification

## Overview

The `<input type="file">` (or file input) element is a control that provides
the user with the ability to select local files.

### Background

The file input allows users to upload one or multiple files, which may or may
not be part of a form submission.

Currently, this control is the only way access to access a user's filesystem.

### Use Cases

The file input is widely used across the web. Examples include attaching
documents to a job or visa application, and uploading multimedia content to
cloud storage services.

### Non-goals

The file input does not provide a way to programatically invoke access to a
user's filesystem, other than invoking `click()`.

### Features

This control invokes a prompt to the user requesting that the user specify one
or more files to upload. Once selected, the prompt collapses and input is
updated with the selected files.

### Risks and Challenges

There are no risks or challenges presented as a part of this proposal.

### Prior Art/Examples

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/upload/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#form-controls)
- [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/file-uploader/usage/)
- [Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/components/filepicker)
- [Materialise](https://materializecss.com/text-inputs.html)
- [MOJ](https://moj-design-system.herokuapp.com/components/multi-file-upload)

Examples can also be found within platforms like GitHub (attaching binaries to
a release), along with many government sites.

## Design

The file input consists of two parts: a button, and a label. Clicking the
button invokes the file selection prompt.

## Behavior

### States and Interactions

When the input is invoked, the file selection prompt will limit the user to
selecting files that match the `accept` attribute, and the user will be limited
to selecting a single file unless the `multiple` attribute is `true`.

When a file are selected, the `label` updates to show the filename. When set to
`multiple`, the number of selected files is shown instead of a filename.

If a user cancels the prompt (choosing not to select a file), the input shows
the default (no selection) state. This also clears any previously selected
files.

#### Drag and drop

Users may also drag and drop files onto the input, where the drop target is the
containing element.

#### Accessibility

The file input should be focusable via keyboard navigation (tab).

#### Keyboard Navigation and Focus

When no files have been selected, there will be one tap stop for the entire control
([resolution](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/107#issuecomment-646344160)).

#### Form Input

The file input integrates with forms, accepting the `required` attribute for
validation.

#### Use with Assistive Technology

The `openui-file` component should appear as a `button` (ARIA role) along with
a `label` representing the current selection state.

As with other form controls, a `label` should be used to give context to this
control.

### Globalization

The positions of the button and label should be reversed for languages written
RTL (right-to-left).

### Security

The `<input type="file">` element doesn't allow applictions access to the
filesystem, and the value is prefixed with a [fake path](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#fakepath-srsly).

## Performance

There are no current performance concerns for the file input.

## Dependencies

No third party dependencies are required.

### Platform Requirements

To implement a custom file input, a developer must create a hidden
`<input type="file">` element, and call `click()` on that element to invoke
that input's behaviour.

The [Native File System API](https://wicg.github.io/native-file-system/)
will allow for implementations of file input controls without the above
workaround.

### Tooling

No additional tooling is required for the file input.

## Next steps

Some file input implementations list selected files for the user to review,
deselect/remove, and possibly rename. There is not specification for this
behaviour.
